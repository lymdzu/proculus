                As embedded technologies around the world are becoming more advanced and 
                consumer expectations are high, a well-designed user interface lies at the 
                forefront of a product's success. The GUI must be feature-rich and sophisticated, 
                yet easy to use.

            Proculus tools are known for letting interface designers quickly prototype an interface. 
            Nobody is better or faster at this than us. If you're looking to design a user interface 
            that redefines the way things are done, you'll want to try out your concept to see 
            how they work.
